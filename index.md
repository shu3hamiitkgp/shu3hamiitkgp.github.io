## About Me

I'm a Data Scientist and Product Developer based in Boston, Massachusetts. In my recent stint at Graduate school, I tried my hands on a variety of topics in the data ecosystem viz. Applied Deep Learning, Data Engineering, and Network Science. I developed a growing interest in Applied research, and end-to-end ML product development, and wish to continue similar work in my next role.

Before this, I enjoyed my work in Credit & Fraud Risk Data Science at American Express, where I got a chance to work on both Modeling and Risk Strategy fronts contributing to Global Collections and US Commercial limits teams.

I'm open to partnering for work and exciting opportunities. Look forward to connecting!

### Founder - GrocerEase: Smart Digitization of Groceries
- GrocerEase is a new-age startup helping its users digitize the process of tracking groceries efficiently and simply. We address a very common problem of forgetfulness among grocery shoppers, which results in redundant purchases and food wastage quite often.
- The user just needs to click a picture of the grocery purchase receipt, and the app automatically digitizes the items, along with their quantity in a tabular format, and additionally estimates a tentative expiry date based on the internal database to give out expiry alerts, such that the product can be used before it's about to expire.We use **Deep learning** and **Computer Vision** under the hood to develop our product
- Finished among the Top 5 finalists competing for $10K seed funding in the Husky Startup challenge at Northeastern University (A student-led startup incubator by the Entrepreneurship Cell)

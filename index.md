## About Me

I'm a Data Scientist and Product Developer based in Boston, Massachusetts. In my recent stint at Graduate school, I tried my hands on a variety of topics in the data ecosystem viz. Applied Deep Learning, Data Engineering, and Network Science. I developed a growing interest in Applied research, and end-to-end ML product development, and wish to continue similar work in my next role.

Before this, I enjoyed my work in Credit & Fraud Risk Data Science at American Express, where I started as a fresh graduate from IIT Kharagpur in India.

I'm open to partnering for work and exciting opportunities. Look forward to connecting!

### Founder - GrocerEase: Smart Digitization of Groceries
- GrocerEase is a new-age startup helping its users digitize the process of tracking groceries efficiently and simply. We address a very common problem of forgetfulness among grocery shoppers, which results in redundant purchases and food wastage quite often.
- The user just needs to click a picture of the grocery purchase receipt, and the app automatically digitizes the items, along with their quantity in a tabular format, and additionally estimates a tentative expiry date based on the internal database to give out expiry alerts, such that the product can be used before it's about to expire.We use **Deep learning** and **Computer Vision** under the hood to develop our product
- Finished among the Top 5 finalists competing for $10K seed funding in the Husky Startup challenge at Northeastern University (A student-led startup incubator by the Entrepreneurship Cell)
